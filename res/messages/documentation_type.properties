type.flag.is_custom=<p>Instructs Setup that the type is a custom type. Whenever the end user manually changes the components selection during installation, Setup will set the setup type to the custom type. Note that if you don't define a custom type, Setup will only allow the user to choose a setup type and he/she can no longer manually select/unselect components.</p>\
                     <p>Only one type may include this flag.</p>
