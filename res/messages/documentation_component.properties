component.flag.checkable_alone=<p>Specifies that the component can be checked when none of its children are. By default, if no <tt>Components</tt> parameter directly references the component, unchecking all of the component's children will cause the component to become unchecked.</p>
component.flag.dont_inherit_check=<p>Specifies that the component should not automatically become checked when its parent is checked. Has no effect on top-level components, and cannot be combined with the <tt>exclusive</tt> flag.</p>
component.flag.exclusive=<p>Instructs Setup that this component is mutually exclusive with sibling components that also have the <tt>exclusive</tt> flag.</p>
component.flag.fixed=<p>Instructs Setup that this component can not be manually selected or unselected by the end user during installation.</p>
component.flag.restart=<p>Instructs Setup to ask the user to restart the system if this component is installed, regardless of whether this is necessary (for example because of [Files] section entries with the <tt>restartreplace</tt> flag). Like <a href="topic_setup_alwaysrestart.htm">AlwaysRestart</a> but per component.</p>
component.flag.disable_no_uninstall_warning=<p>Instructs Setup not to warn the user that this component will not be uninstalled after he/she deselected this component when it's already installed on his/her machine.</p>\
                                             <p>Depending on the complexity of your components, you can try to use the [InstallDelete] section and this flag to automatically 'uninstall' deselected components.</p>
